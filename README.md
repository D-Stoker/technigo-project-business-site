# D. Stoker Portfolio

## Project Overview: 
This project involves creating a responsive business landing page with a hero image/video, and a signup form that posts to an external service. It focuses on practicing HTML form elements, responsive design, and clean coding practices.

As the project requirements referenced creating a company or utilizing a preexisting one, this project creation is a web development portfolio that highlights current work with the intention to future-proof areas for further additions.

## Key Features:
-	Hero section: a responsive web development themed hero image, spanning the screen with on devices of all sizes, linked with call-to-actions beneath it.
-	Signup form: HTML form with at least three input types (i.e. text, email, telephone, etc.) designed to simulate backend interaction by submitting data to HTTPBin for testing purposes. This ensures functionality before integrating with a real back-end service.
-	Styling and responsiveness: to ensure the portfolio site is visually appealing and accessible on devices ranging from 320px to 1600px, I adopted a mobile-first design approach. Starting with the smallest screens allowed me to focus on core functionality and progressively enhance the design for larger devices using CSS media queries. Key styling choices included a harmonious color palette, consistent typography, and a layout that balances whitespace and content flow. The contact form was designed to be user-friendly across all devices, with stackable input fields for small screens and additional spacing for larger ones. By using responsive units and touch-friendly elements, I achieved a design that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional on any screen size.
-	Deployment: deployed live site on Netlify (https://bizbusiness.netlify.app/).

## Approach & Workflow: 
I spent a full week planning the layout, creating a style guide, and identifying key features before diving into the code. This allowed me to approach the project methodically, minimizing roadblocks and ensuring a smooth development process.

## Design & Content:
-	Hero section: highlighted with a headline (“Web dev solutions”), subtext (“from concept to code: making your ideas come to life”), and call-to-action buttons (i.e. “see my portfolio”, “let’s work together”) in support of a web development themed hero image.
-	About section: a brief introduction linking past work to the new web development journey.
-	Portfolio teaser: A placeholder for a carousel showcasing project previews (to be updated with boot camp projects).
-	Contact form: set for generating leads through the provision of name, email, phone, services interested in, project description text box, budget range, project timeline, anti-spam confirmation, and submit button.
-	Footer: minimalist footer design with placeholder contact and social links.

## Advanced features:
In the near future, I plan to implement a custom image carousel, parallax scrolling for visual depth, and sticky navigation for improved user experience. Long-term goals include adding authentication, dynamic content using APIs, and advanced search functionality.

## Tools and Techniques Used:
This project was built using HTML5 for semantic structure and CSS3 for styling, focusing on a clean and responsive design.

-	Media queries were applied to create a mobile-first design, adjusting styles for various screen widths (320px to 1600px) and ensuring seamless responsiveness across devices.
-	Flexbox: Utilized for layout alignment and spacing in components such as the navigation bar, form elements, and call-to-action buttons, ensuring a flexible structure that adapts well to different screen sizes.
-	Hero Image Styling: The hero image uses width: 100%, height: auto, and object-fit: cover to maintain its aspect ratio while adapting responsively to various container dimensions.
-	Custom Styling: A cohesive visual identity was achieved through CSS variables for consistent colors, typography, and spacing.
-	For form handling, HTTPBin was used to test submissions efficiently during development.
Deployment was managed via Netlify, offering quick and straightforward hosting with continuous deployment for seamless updates.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, I created a functional and polished portfolio site that adapts to different user needs.

## Deployment:
For deployment, I used Netlify, which allows for seamless and automated deployment from a GitHub repository. Once the project was pushed to GitHub, I connected the repository to Netlify, which automated the deployment process. This enables easy maintenance and updates, by pushing new commits to the repository for the changes to go live.

## What’s next:
Moving forward, I plan to add advanced UI features, dynamic content, and explore mobile development. In the long term, I’ll focus on expanding my skills with web frameworks like React or Vue.js, and eventually venture into full-stack development. These steps will shape both my project and my growth as a developer.
